# Automatic Character Timeline Generation from Books (NLP)

Novels often contain many places, characters and organisations each with their own unique names. As the plot thickens,
these can become difficult to follow.
nlp-timeline-gen aims to make this easier by generating a timeline of where people are at what times using 
[state-of-the-art natural language processing](https://spacy.io/).
