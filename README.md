Novels often contain many places, characters and organisations each with their own unique names. As the plot thickens,
these can become difficult to follow.
nlp-timeline-gen aims to make this easier by generating a timeline of where people are at what times using 
[state-of-the-art natural language processing](https://spacy.io/).
